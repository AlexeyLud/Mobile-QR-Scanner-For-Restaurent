This project is my coursework related to a mobile QR code scanner for the restaurant business. 
This project is written in Java for Android. 
It required the connection of a third-party library.
ZXing(Zebra Crossing) is a library that provides access to barcode scanning on Android:
 implementation 'me.dm7.barcodescanner:zxing:1.9'
 implementation 'com.google.zxing:core:3.4.1'
